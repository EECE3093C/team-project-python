## by: Jordan Shaheen, Chris Vu, Hung Vo

### Vision
__What is your product (high-level view)?__<br>

    Our software application will allow the user to input a starting position and ending position.

__Whom is it for?__<br>

    This application can be used for anyone who wants to find the shortest route on UC, including hadicapped people.

__What problem does it solve?__<br>

    This application solves the problem of wasting time/getting lost finding your destination within UC campus.  

__What alternatives are available, who are your competitors?__<br>

    Competitors are Google Maps and well as other GPS applications.

__What is novel in your approach, that is why is this project compelling and worth developing?__<br>

    This project is worth developing because it will allow a more detailed description on what campus paths to take to any building on campus.
    Most GPS application are not too specific when it comes to UC's campus routes.  

### Software Architecture

__Make it clear that the system can be built, making good use of the available resources and technology.__<br>

__Describe at a very high level the system's architecture, identifying the components/modules that will interact.__<br>

__Describe the specific data you will access/store.__<br>

__What languages/toolkits do you intend to use for the development?__<br>

### Challenges and Risks
__What is the single most serious challenge you see in developing the product on schedule?__<br>
  
__How will you minimize or mitigate the risk?__<br>
